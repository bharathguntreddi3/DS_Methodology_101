The last stage in the methodology is feedback. This includes results collected from the deployment of the model, 
feedback on the modelâ€™s performance from the users and clients, and observations from how the model works in the deployed environment.

Data scientists analyze the feedback received, which helps them refine the model. 
It is also a highly iterative stage as there is a continuous back and forth between the modeling and feedback stages. 
This process continues till the model is providing satisfactory and acceptable results.
