Analytic Approach :
		After the problem has been clearly defined, the analytical approach will come into action, to solve the problem,
which means expressing the problem into framework of statistical and machine learning techniques. There are different modles that can be depending on the outcomes needed.

-> Statistical approach can be used if it requores summarising, counting, finding trends in the data.
   To assess the relationships between various elements and environment and how they affect each other , a descriptive model can be used.

-> A Predictive model can be used which is a data mining technique. A training set that is a set of historical data that includes its outcomes, is used for predictive modeling.


Descriptive approach : Current status and information provided.

Diagnostic approach : statistical analysis, whats is happening and why it is happening.

Predictive approach : Forecasts on the trends or future events probability.

Prescriptive approach : How the problem should be solved actually.
