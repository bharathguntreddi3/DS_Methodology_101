In this stage, the data scientist tries to understand the data collected. 
This involves applying descriptive analysis and visualization techniques to the data. 
This will help in a better understanding of the data content and the quality of the data and developing initial insights from the data. 
If there are any gaps identified in this step, the data scientist can go back to the previous step and gather more data.
