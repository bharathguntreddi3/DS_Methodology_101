This stage comprises all the activities needed to construct the data to make it suitable to be used for the modeling stage. 
This includes data cleaning i.e. managing missing data, deleting duplicates, changing the data into a uniform format, etc., 
combining data from various sources, and transforming data into useful variables.

This is one of the most time-consuming steps. However, there are automated methods available today that can accelerate the process of data preparation. 
At the end of this stage, only the data needed to solve the problem is retained to make the model run smoothly with minimal errors.
