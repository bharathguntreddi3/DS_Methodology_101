The dataset prepared in the previous stage is used for creating the modeling stage. 
Here the type of model to be used is defined by the approach decided upon in the analytical approach stage. 
Thus, the kind of dataset varies depending on whether it is a descriptive, predictive approach or a statistical analysis.

This is one of the most iterative processes in the methodology as the data scientist will use multiple algorithms to arrive at the best model for the chosen variables. 
It also involves combining various business insights that are continuously being discovered which leads to refining the prepared data and model.
